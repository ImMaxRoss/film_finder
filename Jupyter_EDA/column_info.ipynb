For now I'm sticking with 'Prime Video' because I believe there could be ratings impacted by price in other 'style' formats such as 'Amazon Video'. Since the prices for each video-stream/physical-media differ it may influence how people percieve it's content and could impact the effectiviness of the recommendation system. So keeping just 'Prime Video' for now since all content is free with a subscription)\n",
