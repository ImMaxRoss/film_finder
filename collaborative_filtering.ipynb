    "# Project Overview\n",
    "The main goal for this project is to Develop a hybrid movie/TV recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest new content to users. Currently, these techniques are applied independently. Our project aims to harness their combined potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes existing user profiles to discover shared preferences and recommend new content based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests new content with similar fearures to the movie/TV show that you input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "As streaming platforms pile-up content, users struggle to pinpoint films or shows that align with their tastes. The dubious presence of bias in platform algorithms exacerbates this challenge, making it harder for users to rely on platform recommendations. Biases emerge from factors like skewed user preferences, popularity bias, or even the platform's promotional agenda. As a result, recommended content may not cater to users' unique tastes, negatively affecting the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming platforms stand to gain from implementing an unbiased hybrid recommendation system that blends content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This approach leverages the best of both methods, increasing reliability and personalization while mitigating biases. The content-based technique analyzes features like genre and content description, while collaborative filtering harnesses the collective trends of user ratings. Together, they forge a powerful recommendation engine, enhancing user satisfaction and overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the collaborative filtering approach, we focused on user-to-user filtering, comparing users' profiles to identify similarities in movie preferences by looking at the ratings they gave to movies that they have both watched. We started by creating a base model as a benchmark, which predicted the mean rating for each movie. To improve the recommendations, we iterated over two models: an SVD model and an SVDpp model. In the iteration process, we used cross-validation in tandem with GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for our models, optimizing their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cross-validation and GridSearchCV process helped us fine-tune our models to achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 0.908. Given that our dataset contains user ratings on a scale of 1 to 5, a 0.908 RMSE score signifies good performance in predicting users' movie ratings. It indicates that, on average, our model's predictions deviate by 0.908 from the actual user ratings. This performance enables more accurate and personalized recommendations for users based on their shared preferences, enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction."

Although previously available on DVD as the &lt;I&gt;Alien Legacy&lt;/I&gt;, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form. &lt;I&gt;Alien&lt;/I&gt; (1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron's &lt;I&gt;Aliens&lt;/I&gt; (1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternative &lt;I&gt;Alien 3&lt;/I&gt; (1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different. &lt;I&gt;Alien: Resurrection&lt;/I&gt; (1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer. The &lt;I&gt;Alien Quadrilogy&lt;/I&gt; offers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the first &lt;I&gt;Alien&lt;/I&gt; DVD release are missing here. Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by the &lt;I&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/I&gt; extended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the old &lt;I&gt;Alien&lt;/I&gt; laserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe the &lt;I&gt;Alien Quadrilogy&lt;/I&gt;, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time. &lt;I&gt;--Gary S.

The film opens in Poland, as young Jakob Berr (Robbie Kay) is hidden away just before German soldiers storm into his Jewish family's home. After watching his parents murdered and his sister dragged away to an uncertain fate, Jakob flees and hides in the woods. He is discovered by a kindly Greek archaeologist, Athos (Rade Sherbedgia), who smuggles the sickly Jakob back to his own island home and hides him for the rest of the war. Years later, having moved to Canada, the grownup Jakob (Stephen Dillane) has become a writer struggling to articulate his childhood horrors, haunted by the mystery of his sister's fate. But after his troubled emotions lead to the breakup of his marriage to the free-spirited Alex (Rosamund Pike), Jakob must exorcise the ghosts of his past if he is to close a traumatic chapter of his life and find beauty in the present. Director Jeremy Podeswa (THE FIVE SENSES) ably shifts between the different stages of Jakob's life, showing how grief can continue to influence one's actions--or inaction--in the years that follow a tragedy.

Haunted by the ghost of his predecessor (Stephen Ouimette), he struggles to realize his creative vision while handling touchy actors, a jittery general manager (Mark McKinney), a pretentious guest director (Don McKellar) and his own tempestuous romance with the festival's leading lady (Martha Burns). The backstage bedlam mirrors the onstage angst as Geoffrey directs three of Shakespeare's masterpieces -- &lt;i&gt;Hamlet&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macbeth&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;King Lear&lt;/i&gt; -- one in each season.

       "      <td>&lt;![CDATA[ Popeye The Sailor: 1933-1938 Volume One (DVD) Spinach--YUCK! But not to the most famous, fearless comic strip sailor in the world--Popeye. Whether romancing his longtime sweetheart, Olive Oyl, rescuing defenseless infant Swee'pea, or wrestling his nasty nemesis, Bluto, Popeye summons his spinach-induced strength to save the day. With one gulp of the vitamin-rich vegetable, Popeye transforms his scrawny body into a human dynamo! For high seas hijinks or landlocked levity, turn to the hilarious animated antics of that two-fisted tar--Popeye. In 1933, a squint-eyed sailor with outsized forearms danced a hula with Betty Boop--and began one of the great series in American cartoon history. Popeye had made his debut in Elzie Segar's comic strip \"Thimble Theater\" four years earlier, and the jump to animation only increased his popularity: by 1938, he rivaled Mickey Mouse. During the '30s, when Disney was creating lushly colored, realistic animation, the Fleischer Studio presented a gritty black-and-white world that was ideally suited to the bizarre misadventures of Popeye, Olive, and Bluto. The animators ignored anatomy, with hilarious results: Olive Oyl's rubbery arms wrap around her body like twin anacondas, and her legs often end up in knots. Exactly what Popeye and Bluto saw in this scrawny, capricious inamorata was never clear, but they fought over her endlessly. As the series progressed, the artists grew more sophisticated: in \"Blow Me Down\" (1933), Olive does some clumsy steps to \"The Mexican Hat Dance;\" one year later, in \"The Dance Contest,\" she and Popeye perform deft spoofs of tango, tap, and apache steps. The stories are little more than strings of gags linked by a theme: Popeye and Bluto as rival artists; Popeye and Olive as nightclub dancers or caf owners. But the minimal stories allow the artists to fill the screen with jokes, over-the-top fights, and muttered asides from the characters. Cartoon fans have waited for years for the \"Popeye\" shorts to appear on disc, and the &lt;I&gt;Popeye the Sailor 1933-1938&lt;/I&gt; was worth waiting for. The transfers were made from beautifully clear prints with only minimal dust and scratches. The set is loaded with extras, including eight \"Popumentaries,\" numerous commentaries, and 16 silent cartoons. It's a set to treasure. (Unrated, suitable for ages 10 and older: violence, tobacco use, ethnic stereotypes) &lt;I&gt;--Charles Solomon&lt;/I&gt;</td>\n",

       "4  Includes \"Alien,\" \"Aliens,\" \"Alien 3,\" and \"Alien: Resurrection.\" The <I>Alien Quadrilogy</I> is a nine-disc boxed set devoted to the four <I>Alien</I> films. Although previously available on DVD as the <I>Alien Legacy</I>, here they have been repackaged with vastly more extras and with upgraded sound and picture. For anyone who hasn't been in hypersleep for the last 25 years, this series needs no introduction, though for the first time each film now comes in both original and \"special edition\" form. <I>Alien</I> (1979) was so perfect it didn't need fixing, and Ridley Scott's 2003 director's cut is fiddling for the sake of fiddling. Watch it once, then return to the majestic, perfectly paced original. Conversely, the special edition of James Cameron's <I>Aliens</I> (1986) is the definitive version, though it's nice to finally have the theatrical cut on DVD for comparison. Most interesting is the alternative <I>Alien 3</I> (1992). This isn't a \"director's cut\"--David Fincher refused to have any involvement with this release--but a 1991 work-print that runs 29 minutes longer than the theatrical version, and has now been restored, remastered, and finished off with (unfortunately) cheap new CGI. Still, it's truly fascinating, offering a different insight into a flawed masterpiece. The expanded opening is visually breathtaking, the central firestorm is much longer, and a subplot involving Paul McGann's character adds considerable depth to story. The ending is also subtly but significantly different. <I>Alien: Resurrection</I> (1997) always was a mess with a handful of brilliant scenes, and the special edition just makes it eight minutes longer. The <I>Alien Quadrilogy</I> offers the first and fourth films with DTS soundtracks, the others having still fine Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation. All four films sound fantastic, with much low-level detail revealed for the first time. Each is anamorphically enhanced at the correct original aspect ratio, and the prints and transfers are superlative. Every film offers a commentary track that lends insight into the creative process--though the Scott-only commentary and isolated music score from the first <I>Alien</I> DVD release are missing here. Each movie is complemented by a separate disc packed with hours of seriously detailed documentaries (all presented in full-screen with clips letterboxed), thousands of photos, production stills, and storyboards, giving a level of inside information for the dedicated buff only surpassed by the <I>Lord of the Rings</I> extended DVD sets. A ninth DVD compiles miscellaneous material, including an hourlong documentary and even all the extras from the old <I>Alien</I> laserdisc. \"Exhaustive\" hardly beings to describe the <I>Alien Quadrilogy</I>, a set that establishes the new DVD benchmark for retrospective releases and looks unlikely to be surpassed for some time. <I>--Gary S. Dalkin</I>   \n",

The film opens in Poland, as young Jakob Berr (Robbie Kay) is hidden away just before German soldiers storm into his Jewish family's home. After watching his parents murdered and his sister dragged away to an uncertain fate, Jakob flees and hides in the woods. He is discovered by a kindly Greek archaeologist, Athos (Rade Sherbedgia), who smuggles the sickly Jakob back to his own island home and hides him for the rest of the war. Years later, having moved to Canada, the grownup Jakob (Stephen Dillane) has become a writer struggling to articulate his childhood horrors, haunted by the mystery of his sister's fate. But after his troubled emotions lead to the breakup of his marriage to the free-spirited Alex (Rosamund Pike), Jakob must exorcise the ghosts of his past if he is to close a traumatic chapter of his life and find beauty in the present. Director Jeremy Podeswa (THE FIVE SENSES) ably shifts between the different stages of Jakob's life, showing how grief can continue to influence one's actions--or inaction--in the years that follow a tragedy.

But not to the most famous, fearless comic strip sailor in the world--Popeye. Whether romancing his longtime sweetheart, Olive Oyl, rescuing defenseless infant Swee'pea, or wrestling his nasty nemesis, Bluto, Popeye summons his spinach-induced strength to save the day. With one gulp of the vitamin-rich vegetable, Popeye transforms his scrawny body into a human dynamo! For high seas hijinks or landlocked levity, turn to the hilarious animated antics of that two-fisted tar--Popeye. In 1933, a squint-eyed sailor with outsized forearms danced a hula with Betty Boop--and began one of the great series in American cartoon history. Popeye had made his debut in Elzie Segar's comic strip \"Thimble Theater\" four years earlier, and the jump to animation only increased his popularity: by 1938, he rivaled Mickey Mouse. During the '30s, when Disney was creating lushly colored, realistic animation, the Fleischer Studio presented a gritty black-and-white world that was ideally suited to the bizarre misadventures of Popeye, Olive, and Bluto. The animators ignored anatomy, with hilarious results: Olive Oyl's rubbery arms wrap around her body like twin anacondas, and her legs often end up in knots. Exactly what Popeye and Bluto saw in this scrawny, capricious inamorata was never clear, but they fought over her endlessly. As the series progressed, the artists grew more sophisticated: in \"Blow Me Down\" (1933), Olive does some clumsy steps to \"The Mexican Hat Dance;\" one year later, in \"The Dance Contest,\" she and Popeye perform deft spoofs of tango, tap, and apache steps. The stories are little more than strings of gags linked by a theme: Popeye and Bluto as rival artists; Popeye and Olive as nightclub dancers or caf owners. But the minimal stories allow the artists to fill the screen with jokes, over-the-top fights, and muttered asides from the characters. Cartoon fans have waited for years for the \"Popeye\" shorts to appear on disc, and the <I>Popeye the Sailor 1933-1938</I> was worth waiting for. The transfers were made from beautifully clear prints with only minimal dust and scratches. The set is loaded with extras, including eight \"Popumentaries,\" numerous commentaries, and 16 silent cartoons. It's a set to treasure.

This year, Will hip-hops over to the same prep school as Carlton and starts scoping out colleges. While Will tries to work his mojo on reluctant Monique, Hilary breaks into show business and learns some hard lessons. But the kids arent the only ones riding lifes highs and lows. Philip (James Avery) jumps into the race for superior court judge, opposing his sleazy but powerful former mentor (Sherman Hemsley, The Jeffersons). And Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) surprises everyone by announcing that shes pregnant! Also appearing in this hilarious and poignant season are Oprah Winfrey, Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty), comic D.L. Hughley, singer Tom Jones and boxer Riddick Bowe. All 24 episodes are fresh  and ready for your enjoyment. &lt;i&gt;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/i&gt;'s third season simultaneously provided some of the best and worst episodes of the show's six-year run. Set up as a classic collision of streets and society, the show soon found Will (Will Smith) beginning to adapt a little too well to his upper-crust home. He transfers to the same prep academy as Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), peruses Ivy League colleges, and truly starts to believe everything comes to him easily. Two spoiled characters (Carlton and Hilary, played by Karyn Parsons) are tolerable, but three begins to get grating. Five is even worse, if you count parents Philip and Vivian Banks (James Avery and Janet Hubert-Whitten), who jumped on the whining bandwagon just enough for their tired butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) to abruptly quit for one episode. While strong family core values remained the show's focus (Avery and Hubert-Whitten are good role models for parents who dont try to be their children's buddy), Will became less of a good-natured jokester and more of a flagrant womanizer, going as far as to trick an abstinent girl (Kim Fields) into thinking they had married to get her into bed. Other less entertaining storylines included Philip's run for Superior Court judge against his sleazy mentor (Sherman Helmsley), and Will's possession of drugs, which Carlton accidentally consumes and nearly dies from (leading to the first of Smith's clumsy attempts at teary confrontations; in later seasons he would prove more successful at them). The show also wrote in Hubert-Whitten's pregnancy resulting in a new baby for the Banks, and gave Hilary a \"real\" job as a weather girl. Season three's highlights include the Banks family's appearance on &lt;i&gt;Oprah&lt;/i&gt;, and more instances of Carlton's famous dance to Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" -- with guest appearance by Jones as his guardian angel. And that, we can never get enough of.--&lt;i&gt;Ellen A. Kim&lt;/i&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;![CDATA[ Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The: The Complete Fourth Season (DVD) Charming and cocky Will continues his reign as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the fourth fast-paced season of this hit family comedy with heart. Will and Carlton are living large at college  even though they live in their familys pool house. When theyre not hunting the honeys, like the superhot Jackie (Tyra Banks), the boys pledge a fraternity, where Will finds out that racism cuts both ways. At home, Will sneaks the dieting Philip some snacks, not realizing hes endangering his uncles life. And Ashley breaks out of her childhood shell in a big way by undergoing an extremely sexy makeover, exploring the dating world and demanding some Respect from her parents by belting out the classic song. Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner, Dick Clark, Ben Vereen (Roots), Robert Guillaume (Benson), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), jazzman Branford Marsalis and Boys II Men guest star in this laugh-filled 26-episode season of the freshest show around. The fourth season of &lt;i&gt;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/i&gt; (which aired on television for six years) finds Will (Will Smith) and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) as college freshmen trying to fit in on campus. Carlton's mom, Vivian, who was played by Janet Hubert-Whitten, is now portrayed by the attractive but not-as-funny Daphne Maxwell Reid. And supermodel Tyra Banks shows up as Will's latest girlfriend, Jackie. While not quite as strong as the series' first two years, this fourth season--which aired from 1993 to 1994--still packs plenty of laughs. Smith, who at the time was busily parlaying his TV success into a film career, had not yet become a huge movie star. His charm and likeability were more important at this time than his acting skills, but Smith's charisma is undeniable. Whether he's manipulating his indulgent uncle Philip (James Avery), bossing around his bumbling cousin Carlton, or basically pimping out his other cousin Hilary (Karyn Parsons) to a professor in order to get a good grade, Will comes across as a good boy who does stupid things. There is always a lesson learned and, just as often, a lesson forgotten. Though played for laughs, the series also deals with serious subject matters in an evenhanded way. After Philip is told to diet and exercise, Will thinks he's doing his uncle a favor by sneaking him fatty meals. When Philip has a heart attack, Will has to deal with the consequences of what he did. Did he give Philip the snacks to make his uncle happy, or because it made him feel good to go against authority? When Will is accepted into a snooty African-American fraternity that rejects Carlton, he learns what it's like to discriminate against your own people. Some of the characters on &lt;i&gt;The Fresh Prince&lt;/i&gt; by now have overstayed their welcome. Hilary has become a caricature of the spoiled and ineffectual rich girl. And as with many sitcoms based around their young stars, Philip and Vivian are superfluous add-ons now. But Carlton's baby sister Ashley (Tatyana Ali), who is growing into a lovely young woman, exhibits spunky exuberance as she tackles the rituals of dating and trying to show her parents she's not a little girl anymore. Ali also gets to show off her singing chops this season, tackling Aretha Franklin's \"Respect.\" As for the show's celebrity guest stars (Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner), it's Smith's former rapping partner DJ Jazzy Jeff who makes the most refreshing appearance as (what else?) Will's buddy from back in the day. &lt;i&gt;--Jae-Ha Kim&lt;/i&gt;</td>\n",

Fans went wild for this wacky, off-the-wall sitcom featuring a misfit alien who departs from the faraway planet of Ork to come study crazy earthling customs. After touching down near Boulder, Colorado, Mork encounters the beautiful college student Mindy (Pam Dawber).

This year, Will hip-hops over to the same prep school as Carlton and starts scoping out colleges. While Will tries to work his mojo on reluctant Monique, Hilary breaks into show business and learns some hard lessons. But the kids arent the only ones riding lifes highs and lows. Philip (James Avery) jumps into the race for superior court judge, opposing his sleazy but powerful former mentor (Sherman Hemsley, The Jeffersons). And Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) surprises everyone by announcing that shes pregnant! Also appearing in this hilarious and poignant season are Oprah Winfrey, Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty), comic D.L. Hughley, singer Tom Jones and boxer Riddick Bowe. All 24 episodes are fresh  and ready for your enjoyment. <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i>'s third season simultaneously provided some of the best and worst episodes of the show's six-year run. Set up as a classic collision of streets and society, the show soon found Will (Will Smith) beginning to adapt a little too well to his upper-crust home. He transfers to the same prep academy as Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), peruses Ivy League colleges, and truly starts to believe everything comes to him easily. Two spoiled characters (Carlton and Hilary, played by Karyn Parsons) are tolerable, but three begins to get grating. Five is even worse, if you count parents Philip and Vivian Banks (James Avery and Janet Hubert-Whitten), who jumped on the whining bandwagon just enough for their tired butler, Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) to abruptly quit for one episode. While strong family core values remained the show's focus (Avery and Hubert-Whitten are good role models for parents who dont try to be their children's buddy), Will became less of a good-natured jokester and more of a flagrant womanizer, going as far as to trick an abstinent girl (Kim Fields) into thinking they had married to get her into bed. Other less entertaining storylines included Philip's run for Superior Court judge against his sleazy mentor (Sherman Helmsley), and Will's possession of drugs, which Carlton accidentally consumes and nearly dies from (leading to the first of Smith's clumsy attempts at teary confrontations; in later seasons he would prove more successful at them). The show also wrote in Hubert-Whitten's pregnancy resulting in a new baby for the Banks, and gave Hilary a \"real\" job as a weather girl. Season three's highlights include the Banks family's appearance on <i>Oprah</i>, and more instances of Carlton's famous dance to Tom Jones' \"It's Not Unusual\" -- with guest appearance by Jones as his guardian angel. And that, we can never get enough of.--<i>Ellen A. Kim</i>   \n",
       "1792760  <![CDATA[ Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The: The Complete Fourth Season (DVD) Charming and cocky Will continues his reign as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the fourth fast-paced season of this hit family comedy with heart. Will and Carlton are living large at college  even though they live in their familys pool house. When theyre not hunting the honeys, like the superhot Jackie (Tyra Banks), the boys pledge a fraternity, where Will finds out that racism cuts both ways. At home, Will sneaks the dieting Philip some snacks, not realizing hes endangering his uncles life. And Ashley breaks out of her childhood shell in a big way by undergoing an extremely sexy makeover, exploring the dating world and demanding some Respect from her parents by belting out the classic song. Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner, Dick Clark, Ben Vereen (Roots), Robert Guillaume (Benson), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), jazzman Branford Marsalis and Boys II Men guest star in this laugh-filled 26-episode season of the freshest show around. The fourth season of <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</i> (which aired on television for six years) finds Will (Will Smith) and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) as college freshmen trying to fit in on campus. Carlton's mom, Vivian, who was played by Janet Hubert-Whitten, is now portrayed by the attractive but not-as-funny Daphne Maxwell Reid. And supermodel Tyra Banks shows up as Will's latest girlfriend, Jackie. While not quite as strong as the series' first two years, this fourth season--which aired from 1993 to 1994--still packs plenty of laughs. Smith, who at the time was busily parlaying his TV success into a film career, had not yet become a huge movie star. His charm and likeability were more important at this time than his acting skills, but Smith's charisma is undeniable. Whether he's manipulating his indulgent uncle Philip (James Avery), bossing around his bumbling cousin Carlton, or basically pimping out his other cousin Hilary (Karyn Parsons) to a professor in order to get a good grade, Will comes across as a good boy who does stupid things. There is always a lesson learned and, just as often, a lesson forgotten. Though played for laughs, the series also deals with serious subject matters in an evenhanded way. After Philip is told to diet and exercise, Will thinks he's doing his uncle a favor by sneaking him fatty meals. When Philip has a heart attack, Will has to deal with the consequences of what he did. Did he give Philip the snacks to make his uncle happy, or because it made him feel good to go against authority? When Will is accepted into a snooty African-American fraternity that rejects Carlton, he learns what it's like to discriminate against your own people. Some of the characters on <i>The Fresh Prince</i> by now have overstayed their welcome. Hilary has become a caricature of the spoiled and ineffectual rich girl. And as with many sitcoms based around their young stars, Philip and Vivian are superfluous add-ons now. But Carlton's baby sister Ashley (Tatyana Ali), who is growing into a lovely young woman, exhibits spunky exuberance as she tackles the rituals of dating and trying to show her parents she's not a little girl anymore. Ali also gets to show off her singing chops this season, tackling Aretha Franklin's \"Respect.\" As for the show's celebrity guest stars (Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner), it's Smith's former rapping partner DJ Jazzy Jeff who makes the most refreshing appearance as (what else?) Will's buddy from back in the day. <i>--Jae-Ha Kim</i>   \n",

       "      <td>From David Simon, creator and co-writer of HBO's triple Emmy-winning mini-series &lt;em&gt;The Corner&lt;/em&gt;, this unvarnished, highly realistic HBO series follows a single sprawling drug and murder investigation in Baltimore. Told from the point of view of both the police and their targets, the series captures a universe of subterfuge and surveillance, where easy distinctions between good and evil, and crime and punishment, are challenged at every turn. After one episode of &lt;I&gt;The Wire&lt;/I&gt; you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter from &lt;I&gt;The Baltimore Sun&lt;/I&gt; who cowrote the &lt;a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804109990/${0}\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; that inspired TV's &lt;I&gt;&lt;a href=\"/b/?node=13745601\"&gt;Homicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to &lt;I&gt;&lt;a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009ATJZ/${0}\"&gt;The Corner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/I&gt;) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especially &lt;I&gt;Clockers&lt;/I&gt;), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer of &lt;I&gt;The Shield&lt;/I&gt;'s finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, &lt;I&gt;The Wire&lt;/I&gt; is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2. &lt;I&gt;--Jeff Shannon&lt;/I&gt;</td>\n",

This historic studio was at one time home to a staggering number of silent screen luminaries including &lt;b&gt;Mabel Normand, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Harry Langdon, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, The Keystone Cops, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Billy Bevan, Louise Fazenda, Eddie Quillan,&lt;/b&gt; and countless others. Even Hollywood icon &lt;b&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/b&gt;, still the world's most recognized actor, introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone. Later, under the Mack Sennett Comedies banner, Sennett went on to produce a new generation of sound comedies, some in early color, featuring the likes of &lt;b&gt;W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby, Lloyd Hamilton, Andy Clyde,&lt;/b&gt; and more. Now, for the first time, thanks to Flicker Alley, CineMuseum, and Keystone Films, &lt;b&gt;50 of the best surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re-mastered in HD for Blu-ray home video. &lt;/b&gt; These new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, the Richard M. Roberts Collection, Gierucki Studios, and dozens of privately held archives. &lt;b&gt;Content Highlights:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;KEYSTONE COPS -&lt;/b&gt; Make an appearance in several of the films in &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mack Sennett Collection, Vol. One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Shot in the Excitement&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Noise of Bombs&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bangville Police&lt;/i&gt; (1913), regarded as the seminal &lt;b&gt;Keystone Cop&lt;/b&gt; film. Also included is &lt;i&gt;A Thief Catcher&lt;/i&gt; (1914). Previously thought lost, this short was discovered by producer Paul E. Gierucki in 2010. It features a rare appearance of &lt;B&gt;Charlie Chaplin as a Keystone Cop.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE WATER NYMPH (1912) -&lt;/b&gt; Starring &lt;B&gt;Mabel Normand&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;The Water Nymph&lt;/I&gt; served as the inspiration for the famous &lt;B&gt;Sennett Bathing Beauties&lt;/B&gt;.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;b&gt;FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT (1916) -&lt;/b&gt; A groundbreaking comedy from the most famous comedy team in the world at that time, &lt;b&gt;Mabel Normand and Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle&lt;/b&gt;.

All true, but as demonstrated by the 50 mainly short films digitally restored and gathered in a three-disc Blu-ray set, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mack Sennett Collection Volume One&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (Flicker Alley), he was something more. Sennett defined (or redefined) American humor. There is scarcely a physical clown or verbal wiseguy whose antics or attitude Sennett did not anticipate. Writing in &lt;i&gt;Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies&lt;/i&gt;, the cultural historian Robert Sklar cited Sennett's 'inventive, resourceful vulgarity,' crediting his primitive two-reel comedies with 'cutting a wider swath through society and its values than any previous expression of the comic tradition in America, with the single exception of that 19th-century masterpiece of comic prose, &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt;.' --&lt;b&gt;J. Hoberman, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sennett box is a frankly amazing cavalcade of low comedy that's both culturally revelatory and often hilarious (not to mention jaw-droppingly tasteless). --&lt;b&gt;RogerEbert.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subtitle of this three-disc set of silent-era classics is '50 Digitally Restored Classic Films;' but that doesn't even begin to describe what &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mack Sennett Collection&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; has to offer. The real value is in the commentary tracks by scholars and archivists who talk about how one of Hollywood's all-time greats gathered and nurtured a phenomenal collection of comic talent. --&lt;b&gt;'Noel Murray's Best DVDs of 2014,' &lt;i&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</td>\n",

But Swedish detective Martin Beck is good at one thing: methodically catching criminals so they can be put away for a long time. His tightly-wound partner, Gunvald, is the opposite: an impulsive man who cuts a dashing figure, is in no way politically-correct and who never met a boundary he didnt leap to cross. Hell do anything to get information from a suspect, including enhanced interrogation techniques. Its classic good cop/bad cop, and together with their team they bring down dangerous criminals lurking in the seedy Stockholm underworld. Beck may be a loner but hes not anti-social; he regularly sees his daughter, with whom he has a much better relationship than when he was neglecting her growing up. And at the end of a workday, theres always an interesting conversation and a nightcap with a neighbor who gives new meaning to the word quirky. Episode 7: The Money Man - The double-life of a homosexual police officer leads to a showdown between Beck and his arch-enemy Gavling, a.k.a. The Money Man - a notorious kingpin in the underworld of Stockholm. (Directed by Harald Hamrell) Episode 8: Night Vision - A commuter on the last subway of the night is found decapitated. Beck uncovers a gang of young computer freaks who have transformed the entire underground into a hellish, real-life videogame where innocent people become targets. (Directed by Morten Arnfred) Episode 9: The Revenge - Two patrolling cops are killed after stumbling on to criminals who have just stolen large amounts of explosives.

Gangster Collection, the Warner Bros. Tough Guys Collection delivers six all new to DVD Classics featuring Hollywood's greatest Academy-Award winning Tough guys - James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Edward G. Robinson. Say \"Warner Bros. in the '30s\" and you're talking, first and foremost, about the tough, gritty, urban, street-smart movies that help define that American decade for us. Which means you're talking about James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart: unpretty but charismatic guys with lived-in faces, and bodies that always seemed cocked, ready to spring. When one of them entered a room, he owned it, no matter how many people were there already. Their most celebrated habitat was the gangster picture. The genre didn't originate with them, but they, more than anybody else, defined it, gave it a face and a silhouette and a heartbeat. The films in this set were produced half a decade and more after &lt;i&gt;Little Caesar&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Public Enemy&lt;/i&gt; made stars of Robinson and Cagney, respectively, and after repeal had begun to lend Prohibition the patina of nostalgia. The studio's gangster franchise was evolving, and so were the careers of its top stars. When it came to toughness, the boys could still dish it out, and take it, too. But increasingly they were doing it on the other side of the law-and-order divide. Cagney was first to reform. In 1935's &lt;i&gt;\"G\" Men&lt;/i&gt; he plays a lawyer put through college by the avuncular neighborhood crimelord. After a law-school pal turned F.B.I. agent is murdered, Cagney abandons his (resolutely legit) one-man practice and joins the Bureau. The film memorializes several big moments in F.B.I. legend, but what's grabbiest is the personal drama growing out of Cagney's lingering underworld friendships. William Keighley directs the murders and shootouts with jolting ferocity, Barton MacLane and Edward Pawley supply flavorful villainy, and there are times when Sol Polito's cinematography literally glows (all these films have been restored, but &lt;i&gt;\"G\" Men&lt;/i&gt; looks especially terrific). One gripe: The movie should have been presented without the F.B.I.-classroom intro tacked on for 1949 reissue (which belongs under \"Special Features\"). In &lt;i&gt;Each Dawn I Die&lt;/i&gt; (also Keighley, 1939), Cagney teams with George Raft making his Warners debut. It's mostly a prison picture, with muckraking reporter Cagney behind bars after being framed by crooked politicos. Career felon Raft has little sympathy for him till Cagney proves to be a stand-up guy, whereupon the two bond in mutual loathing of sadistic guards, rat-fink convicts, and the endlessly malleable system. The movie boasts one indelible scene (involving a movie screening for the cons), some evocative prison workhouse detailing, and a fine Cagney performance as always. But it's undone by a script cluttered with melodrama and contrivance. &lt;i&gt;Bullets or Ballots&lt;/i&gt; (Keighley yet again, 1936) is much more satisfying. Again we get two icons for the price of one, with Robinson as a tough but square-shooting police detective and Bogart as the ambitious number-two man to a big-time racketeer. Bogart's effectively the co-star, albeit fourth-billed behind Robinson, Joan Blondell, and Barton MacLane. But it's Eddie G.'s movie, and he walks the line beautifully as an honest cop who, unjustly jettisoned from the force, signs on with the mobster he's long pursued. Despite a rhetorical reference to \"ballots\" as the public's means of combatting crime, it's bullets that get the job done. Bullets and fists: the movie makes clear that Robinson has beaten confessions out of people plenty of times, just as it has no illusions about the empty symbolism of crime commissions and grand juries. The only other Bogart vehicle in the set is &lt;i&gt;San Quentin&lt;/i&gt; (Lloyd Bacon, 1937), a scrap-work effort below the standards of everybody involved. Bogart's a small-time crook whose arrest at a nightclub occasions a meet-cute for his big sister Ann Sheridan and Army training officer Pat O'Brien--who's on his way to become yard captain at the penitentiary where Bogart will be interred! O'Brien tries to reform the lad, but with corrupt/sadistic guard Barton MacLane on one side and sociopathic con Joe Sawyer on the other, Bogart never has a chance. Neither does the viewer. Lloyd Bacon, normally one of Warners' zippiest directors, is back on his game with &lt;i&gt;A Slight Case of Murder&lt;/i&gt; (1938), a delicious gangster &lt;i&gt;comedy&lt;/i&gt;. Robinson plays beer baron Remy Marco, who craves respectability as a legitimate businessman once beer is legal again. Problem is, nobody has ever had the heart to tell him his product tastes like varnish, and soon the bank is out to foreclose on his brewery. At which point Remy learns that his summer home upstate is full of fresh gangland corpses.... Based on a play by Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay, the picture gives a trio of glorious goons--Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy, and Harold Huber--a rare chance to shine as Marco's house staff. &lt;i&gt;City for Conquest&lt;/i&gt; (1940) ought to be the showpiece here. It's the longest and most ambitious entry, with prestige-picture scale and production values (including Polito and James Wong Howe as cameramen) and a cast including Cagney, Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, Frank McHugh, Donald Crisp, Anthony Quinn, Jerome Cowan, and--in his first of only two film performances--future directorial giant Elia Kazan. Working-stiff Cagney loves his gifted musician brother (Kennedy) and childhood sweetheart (Sheridan), a dancer with her own aspirations for the limelight; he becomes a boxer in order to pay for the brother's musical education. Triumph and tragedy ensue. The film's avowed aim, and Kennedy's, is to create an urban symphony of New York and the many little people striving against all odds to rise; there's even a one-man Greek chorus--Frank Craven, the Stage Manager of the recent &lt;i&gt;Our Town&lt;/i&gt;--to hammer the theme periodically. But over the previous decade Warners' honest, hard-charging, small-scale movies had collectively achieved that \"symphony,\" without the pompous flourishes Anatole Litvak's direction brings to the project. Here's hoping DVD showcases more of them. &lt;i&gt;--Richard T. Jameson&lt;/i&gt;</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;br /&gt; English-speaking audiences have always found Die Meistersinger to be a life-enhancing celebration of wisdom, art and song. So it proves in David McVicar's production - the first at Glyndebourne - which is updated to the early-19th century of Wagner's childhood. At the centre of a true ensemble cast is Gerald Finley, a 'gleamingly sung', 'eminently believable' Sachs (The Independent on Sunday), supported by the dynamic conducting of Vladimir Jurowski which, like McVicar's production, uses Glyndebourne's special intimacy to bring sharp focus to bear on the subtlety of Wagner's musical and dramatic counterpoint. &lt;strong&gt;\"Musically, it was judged faultlessly for the scale of the theatre by Vladimir Jurowski, who conjured playing of mercurial clarity - not the first words one would normally choose for this gargantuan score - from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, sustained with unfailing vigilance and concentration.\"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; (The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;\"McVicar's staging stokes the glow of Meistersinger's humane heart...Together they make the immense performance the most uplifting performance I can recall.\"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; (BBC Music Magazine&lt;/em&gt; ) &lt;strong&gt;\"Finley has the role of Hans Sachs massively in focus, both musically and dramatically. \"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Gramophone&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;\"The camerawork – mostly close-up – is superb, focusing on the intimacy of the Glyndebourne stage and the visual expressiveness of a young cast. Vicki Mortimer's Biedermeyer sets are notably more handsome on film than in the theatre, and the performance (captured late in the inaugural run) breathes a general air of wellbeing. \"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; (The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Company:&lt;/strong&gt; Glyndebourne Festival Opera&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Director:&lt;/strong&gt; David McVicar  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;Disc Information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalogue Number:&lt;/strong&gt; OABD7108D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date of Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; 2011&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 300 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound:&lt;/strong&gt; 2.0LPCM + 5.1(5.0) DTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspect Ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; 16:9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtitles:&lt;/strong&gt; EN, FR, DE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Label:&lt;/strong&gt; Opus Arte</td>\n",

Told from the point of view of both the police and their targets, the series captures a universe of subterfuge and surveillance, where easy distinctions between good and evil, and crime and punishment, are challenged at every turn. After one episode of <I>The Wire</I> you'll be hooked. After three, you'll be astonished by the precision of its storytelling. After viewing all 13 episodes of the HBO series' remarkable first season, you'll be cheering a bona-fide American masterpiece. Series creator David Simon was a veteran crime reporter from <I>The Baltimore Sun</I> who cowrote the <a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804109990/${0}\">book</a> that inspired TV's <I><a href=\"/b/?node=13745601\">Homicide</a></I>, and cowriter Ed Burns was a Baltimore cop, lending impeccable street-cred to an inner-city Baltimore saga (and companion piece to <I><a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00009ATJZ/${0}\">The Corner</a></I>) that Simon aptly describes as \"a visual novel\" and \"a treatise on institutions and individuals\" as opposed to a conventional good-vs.-evil police procedural. Owing a creative debt to the novels of Richard Price (especially <I>Clockers</I>), the series opens as maverick Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West, in a star-making role) is tapping into a vast network of drugs and death around southwest Baltimore's deteriorating housing projects. With a mandate to get results ASAP, a haphazard team is assembled to join McNulty's increasingly complex investigation, built upon countless hours of electronic surveillance. The show's split-perspective plotting is so richly layered, so breathtakingly authentic and based on finely drawn characters brought to life by a perfect ensemble cast, that it defies concise description. Simon, Burns, and their cowriters control every intricate aspect of the unfolding epic; directors are top-drawer (including Clark Johnson, helmer of <I>The Shield</I>'s finest episodes), but they are servants to the story, resulting in a TV series like no other: unpredictable, complicated, and demanding the viewer's rapt attention, <I>The Wire</I> is \"an angry show\" (in Simon's words) that refuses to comfort with easy answers to deep-rooted societal problems. Moral gray zones proliferate in a universe where ruthless killers have a logical code, and where the cops are just as ambiguous as their targets. That ambiguity extends to the ending as well; season 1 leaves several issues unresolved, leaving you begging for the even more impressive developments that await in season 2. <I>--Jeff Shannon</I>   \n",

performance of his career in this uplifting and powerful film inspired by true events. Texas cowboy Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) sees his free-wheeling life overturned when he's diagnosed as HIV-positive and given 30 days to live. Determined to survive, Woodroof decides to take matters in his own hands by tracking down alternative treatments from all over the world by means both legal and illegal. After finding an unlikely ally in Rayon (Jared Leto), he establishes a hugely successful \"buyers club\" and unites a band of outcasts in a struggle for dignity and acceptance that inspires in ways no one could have imagined. Co-starring Jennifer Garner, Dallas Buyers Club is \"deeply moving. A livewire of a movie!\" (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone)   \n",

This historic studio was at one time home to a staggering number of silent screen luminaries including <b>Mabel Normand, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Harry Langdon, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, The Keystone Cops, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Billy Bevan, Louise Fazenda, Eddie Quillan,</b> and countless others. Even Hollywood icon <b>Charlie Chaplin</b>, still the world's most recognized actor, introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone. Later, under the Mack Sennett Comedies banner, Sennett went on to produce a new generation of sound comedies, some in early color, featuring the likes of <b>W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby, Lloyd Hamilton, Andy Clyde,</b> and more. Now, for the first time, thanks to Flicker Alley, CineMuseum, and Keystone Films, <b>50 of the best surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re-mastered in HD for Blu-ray home video. </b> These new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, the Richard M. Roberts Collection, Gierucki Studios, and dozens of privately held archives. <b>Content Highlights:</b> <br> <ul> <li><b>KEYSTONE COPS -</b> Make an appearance in several of the films in <b><i>The Mack Sennett Collection, Vol. One</i></b>: <i>Shot in the Excitement</i>, <i>The Noise of Bombs</i>, and <i>Bangville Police</i> (1913), regarded as the seminal <b>Keystone Cop</b> film.

All true, but as demonstrated by the 50 mainly short films digitally restored and gathered in a three-disc Blu-ray set, <b><i>The Mack Sennett Collection Volume One</i></b> (Flicker Alley), he was something more. Sennett defined (or redefined) American humor. There is scarcely a physical clown or verbal wiseguy whose antics or attitude Sennett did not anticipate. Writing in <i>Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies</i>, the cultural historian Robert Sklar cited Sennett's 'inventive, resourceful vulgarity,' crediting his primitive two-reel comedies with 'cutting a wider swath through society and its values than any previous expression of the comic tradition in America, with the single exception of that 19th-century masterpiece of comic prose, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>.' --<b>J. Hoberman, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br /><br />The Sennett box is a frankly amazing cavalcade of low comedy that's both culturally revelatory and often hilarious (not to mention jaw-droppingly tasteless). --<b>RogerEbert.com</b><br /><br />The subtitle of this three-disc set of silent-era classics is '50 Digitally Restored Classic Films;' but that doesn't even begin to describe what <b><i>The Mack Sennett Collection</i></b>; has to offer. The real value is in the commentary tracks by scholars and archivists who talk about how one of Hollywood's all-time greats gathered and nurtured a phenomenal collection of comic talent. --<b>'Noel Murray's Best DVDs of 2014,' <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></b>   \n",

It is an unreal dream.\" - Justice Learned Hand, 1923 In 1986 Michael Morton's wife Christine is brutally murdered in front of their only child, and Michael is convicted of the crime. Locked away in Texas prisons for a quarter century, estranged from his son, he has years to ponder questions of justice and innocence, truth and fate. Though he is virtually invisible to society, the Innocence Project and Michael's pro bono attorney spend years fighting for the right to test DNA evidence found at the murder scene. Their discoveries ultimately reveal that the price of a wrongful conviction goes well beyond one man's loss of freedom. <b> Packaged in a 100% Certified Green Forestry Practices Eco Pack</b> \"A powerful story of pain, injustice, redemption, and reconciliation.\" --The Huffington Post<br /><br />\"Recounts an outrageous miscarriage of justice without a trace of manufactured melodrama or visual hyperbole.

But Swedish detective Martin Beck is good at one thing: methodically catching criminals so they can be put away for a long time. His tightly-wound partner, Gunvald, is the opposite: an impulsive man who cuts a dashing figure, is in no way politically-correct and who never met a boundary he didnt leap to cross. Hell do anything to get information from a suspect, including enhanced interrogation techniques. Its classic good cop/bad cop, and together with their team they bring down dangerous criminals lurking in the seedy Stockholm underworld. Beck may be a loner but hes not anti-social; he regularly sees his daughter, with whom he has a much better relationship than when he was neglecting her growing up. And at the end of a workday, theres always an interesting conversation and a nightcap with a neighbor who gives new meaning to the word quirky. Episode 7: The Money Man - The double-life of a homosexual police officer leads to a showdown between Beck and his arch-enemy Gavling, a.k.a. The Money Man - a notorious kingpin in the underworld of Stockholm. (Directed by Harald Hamrell) Episode 8: Night Vision - A commuter on the last subway of the night is found decapitated. Beck uncovers a gang of young computer freaks who have transformed the entire underground into a hellish, real-life videogame where innocent people become targets. (Directed by Morten Arnfred) Episode 9: The Revenge - Two patrolling cops are killed after stumbling on to criminals who have just stolen large amounts of explosives. Martin Beck and his team must locate the suspects before it's too late. Meanwhile, Gunvald Larsson sets out on his own personal quest for revenge. (Directed by Kjell Sundvall)   \n",
       "6  <![CDATA[ Warner Gangsters Collection Volume 2 (DVD) (6-Pack) Packin' A Punch...and Packin' Heat! On the heels of the success of the Warner Bros. Gangster Collection, the Warner Bros. Tough Guys Collection delivers six all new to DVD Classics featuring Hollywood's greatest Academy-Award winning Tough guys - James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Edward G. Robinson. Say \"Warner Bros. in the '30s\" and you're talking, first and foremost, about the tough, gritty, urban, street-smart movies that help define that American decade for us. Which means you're talking about James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, and Humphrey Bogart: unpretty but charismatic guys with lived-in faces, and bodies that always seemed cocked, ready to spring. When one of them entered a room, he owned it, no matter how many people were there already. Their most celebrated habitat was the gangster picture. The genre didn't originate with them, but they, more than anybody else, defined it, gave it a face and a silhouette and a heartbeat. The films in this set were produced half a decade and more after <i>Little Caesar</i> and <i>The Public Enemy</i> made stars of Robinson and Cagney, respectively, and after repeal had begun to lend Prohibition the patina of nostalgia. The studio's gangster franchise was evolving, and so were the careers of its top stars. When it came to toughness, the boys could still dish it out, and take it, too. But increasingly they were doing it on the other side of the law-and-order divide. Cagney was first to reform. In 1935's <i>\"G\" Men</i> he plays a lawyer put through college by the avuncular neighborhood crimelord. After a law-school pal turned F.B.I. agent is murdered, Cagney abandons his (resolutely legit) one-man practice and joins the Bureau. The film memorializes several big moments in F.B.I. legend, but what's grabbiest is the personal drama growing out of Cagney's lingering underworld friendships. William Keighley directs the murders and shootouts with jolting ferocity, Barton MacLane and Edward Pawley supply flavorful villainy, and there are times when Sol Polito's cinematography literally glows (all these films have been restored, but <i>\"G\" Men</i> looks especially terrific). One gripe: The movie should have been presented without the F.B.I.-classroom intro tacked on for 1949 reissue (which belongs under \"Special Features\"). In <i>Each Dawn I Die</i> (also Keighley, 1939), Cagney teams with George Raft making his Warners debut. It's mostly a prison picture, with muckraking reporter Cagney behind bars after being framed by crooked politicos. Career felon Raft has little sympathy for him till Cagney proves to be a stand-up guy, whereupon the two bond in mutual loathing of sadistic guards, rat-fink convicts, and the endlessly malleable system. The movie boasts one indelible scene (involving a movie screening for the cons), some evocative prison workhouse detailing, and a fine Cagney performance as always. But it's undone by a script cluttered with melodrama and contrivance. <i>Bullets or Ballots</i> (Keighley yet again, 1936) is much more satisfying. Again we get two icons for the price of one, with Robinson as a tough but square-shooting police detective and Bogart as the ambitious number-two man to a big-time racketeer. Bogart's effectively the co-star, albeit fourth-billed behind Robinson, Joan Blondell, and Barton MacLane. But it's Eddie G.'s movie, and he walks the line beautifully as an honest cop who, unjustly jettisoned from the force, signs on with the mobster he's long pursued. Despite a rhetorical reference to \"ballots\" as the public's means of combatting crime, it's bullets that get the job done. Bullets and fists: the movie makes clear that Robinson has beaten confessions out of people plenty of times, just as it has no illusions about the empty symbolism of crime commissions and grand juries. The only other Bogart vehicle in the set is <i>San Quentin</i> (Lloyd Bacon, 1937), a scrap-work effort below the standards of everybody involved. Bogart's a small-time crook whose arrest at a nightclub occasions a meet-cute for his big sister Ann Sheridan and Army training officer Pat O'Brien--who's on his way to become yard captain at the penitentiary where Bogart will be interred! O'Brien tries to reform the lad, but with corrupt/sadistic guard Barton MacLane on one side and sociopathic con Joe Sawyer on the other, Bogart never has a chance. Neither does the viewer. Lloyd Bacon, normally one of Warners' zippiest directors, is back on his game with <i>A Slight Case of Murder</i> (1938), a delicious gangster <i>comedy</i>. Robinson plays beer baron Remy Marco, who craves respectability as a legitimate businessman once beer is legal again. Problem is, nobody has ever had the heart to tell him his product tastes like varnish, and soon the bank is out to foreclose on his brewery. At which point Remy learns that his summer home upstate is full of fresh gangland corpses.... Based on a play by Damon Runyon and Howard Lindsay, the picture gives a trio of glorious goons--Allen Jenkins, Edward Brophy, and Harold Huber--a rare chance to shine as Marco's house staff. <i>City for Conquest</i> (1940) ought to be the showpiece here. It's the longest and most ambitious entry, with prestige-picture scale and production values (including Polito and James Wong Howe as cameramen) and a cast including Cagney, Ann Sheridan, Arthur Kennedy, Frank McHugh, Donald Crisp, Anthony Quinn, Jerome Cowan, and--in his first of only two film performances--future directorial giant Elia Kazan. Working-stiff Cagney loves his gifted musician brother (Kennedy) and childhood sweetheart (Sheridan), a dancer with her own aspirations for the limelight; he becomes a boxer in order to pay for the brother's musical education. Triumph and tragedy ensue. The film's avowed aim, and Kennedy's, is to create an urban symphony of New York and the many little people striving against all odds to rise; there's even a one-man Greek chorus--Frank Craven, the Stage Manager of the recent <i>Our Town</i>--to hammer the theme periodically. But over the previous decade Warners' honest, hard-charging, small-scale movies had collectively achieved that \"symphony,\" without the pompous flourishes Anatole Litvak's direction brings to the project. Here's hoping DVD showcases more of them. <i>--Richard T. Jameson</i>   \n",

So it proves in David McVicar's production - the first at Glyndebourne - which is updated to the early-19th century of Wagner's childhood. At the centre of a true ensemble cast is Gerald Finley, a 'gleamingly sung', 'eminently believable' Sachs (The Independent on Sunday), supported by the dynamic conducting of Vladimir Jurowski which, like McVicar's production, uses Glyndebourne's special intimacy to bring sharp focus to bear on the subtlety of Wagner's musical and dramatic counterpoint. <strong>\"Musically, it was judged faultlessly for the scale of the theatre by Vladimir Jurowski, who conjured playing of mercurial clarity - not the first words one would normally choose for this gargantuan score - from the London Philharmonic Orchestra, sustained with unfailing vigilance and concentration.\"</strong><em> (The Guardian</em>) <strong>\"McVicar's staging stokes the glow of Meistersinger's humane heart...Together they make the immense performance the most uplifting performance I can recall.\"</strong><em> (BBC Music Magazine</em> ) <strong>\"Finley has the role of Hans Sachs massively in focus, both musically and dramatically. \"</strong><em> (Gramophone</em>) <strong>\"The camerawork – mostly close-up – is superb, focusing on the intimacy of the Glyndebourne stage and the visual expressiveness of a young cast. Vicki Mortimer's Biedermeyer sets are notably more handsome on film than in the theatre, and the performance (captured late in the inaugural run) breathes a general air of wellbeing. \"</strong><em> (The Financial Times</em>) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Production</span></strong><br /><strong>Company:</strong> Glyndebourne Festival Opera<br /><strong>Stage Director:</strong> David McVicar  <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Disc Information</span></strong><br /><strong>Catalogue Number:</strong> OABD7108D<br /><strong>Date of Performance:</strong> 2011<br /><strong>Running Time:</strong> 300 minutes<br /><strong>Sound:</strong> 2.0LPCM + 5.1(5.0) DTS<br /><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> 16:9<br /><strong>Subtitles:</strong> EN, FR, DE<br /><strong>Label:</strong> Opus Arte   \n",

Again co-produced by Cinemax and the U.K.s Sky TV, the ten Season 2 episodes (47 min. each) follow Stonebridge, Scott and new boss Rachel Dalton (Rhona Mitra) as they scour Africa in pursuit of a fresh covey of criminals, each vying for possession of a box of valuable nuclear triggers that could launch Armageddon if they fall in the wrong hands.   \n",
