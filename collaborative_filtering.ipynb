    "# Project Overview\n",
    "The main goal for this project is to Develop a hybrid movie/TV recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest new content to users. Currently, these techniques are applied independently. Our project aims to harness their combined potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes existing user profiles to discover shared preferences and recommend new content based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests new content with similar fearures to the movie/TV show that you input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "As streaming platforms pile-up content, users struggle to pinpoint films or shows that align with their tastes. The dubious presence of bias in platform algorithms exacerbates this challenge, making it harder for users to rely on platform recommendations. Biases emerge from factors like skewed user preferences, popularity bias, or even the platform's promotional agenda. As a result, recommended content may not cater to users' unique tastes, negatively affecting the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming platforms stand to gain from implementing an unbiased hybrid recommendation system that blends content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This approach leverages the best of both methods, increasing reliability and personalization while mitigating biases. The content-based technique analyzes features like genre and content description, while collaborative filtering harnesses the collective trends of user ratings. Together, they forge a powerful recommendation engine, enhancing user satisfaction and overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the collaborative filtering approach, we focused on user-to-user filtering, comparing users' profiles to identify similarities in movie preferences by looking at the ratings they gave to movies that they have both watched. We started by creating a base model as a benchmark, which predicted the mean rating for each movie. To improve the recommendations, we iterated over two models: an SVD model and an SVDpp model. In the iteration process, we used cross-validation in tandem with GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for our models, optimizing their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cross-validation and GridSearchCV process helped us fine-tune our models to achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 0.908. Given that our dataset contains user ratings on a scale of 1 to 5, a 0.908 RMSE score signifies good performance in predicting users' movie ratings. It indicates that, on average, our model's predictions deviate by 0.908 from the actual user ratings. This performance enables more accurate and personalized recommendations for users based on their shared preferences, enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction."

From 3 p.m. into the late night, dedicated police, paramedics and firefighters battle crime and cheat death--if they're lucky. Risking their own lives to save others, the men and women of this strange breed prove they've got what it takes to make it through the night and return the next day to face their harsh reality.\", \"&lt;I&gt;Third Watch: The Complete Second Season&lt;/I&gt; continues the critically acclaimed television drama's unique approach to character-driven storylines within a fluid if somewhat familiar milieu. Almost anticipating the now-legendary heroism of New York City's police and rescue workers on September 11, 2001, these early episodes of &lt;I&gt;Third Watch&lt;/I&gt; (the series began in 1999) concern the daily partnership and shared risks between New York cops, firefighters, and paramedics as they attempt to keep people alive in the midst of random chaos. While television shows about public servants are nothing new, what makes &lt;I&gt;Third Watch&lt;/I&gt; both different and engrossing is the way creators John Wells (&lt;I&gt;ER&lt;/I&gt;) and Edward Allen Bernero (&lt;I&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/I&gt;) hone in on one or two characters in each episode, relegating the rest of the cast to minor supporting roles. Thus, an individual who stands out in one episode for his or her efforts to do the job well--despite real-world pressures, lapses in judgment, and moral uncertainty--might appear only briefly, and perhaps less sympathetically, in another episode as seen from a different character's perspective.\", 'That kind of revolving focus not only keeps &lt;I&gt;Third Watch&lt;/I&gt; constantly fresh, it embraces master filmmaker Jean Renoir\\'s famous observation (paraphrased here) that each of us has a reason for being who we are and doing what we do. Beyond its success at turning such an expansive spirit into appealing drama, &lt;I&gt;Third Watch&lt;/I&gt; is also noteworthy for superb writing (much of it by Wells), harrowing set pieces, production values that stress an original, signature look, and a strong emphasis on relationships between on-the-job partners. The cast remains superb, particularly Jason Wiles as an immature, cynical, yet oddly effective young cop, Molly Price as his beleaguered but dedicated partner, and Skipp Sudduth as a veteran police officer whose leadership on the streets belies his rudderless off-duty existence. Among some truly memorable episodes in &lt;I&gt;The Complete Second Season&lt;/I&gt; are \"Four Days,\" in which one of the program\\'s most stable characters, African-American paramedic \"Doc\" Parker (Michael Beach), slowly comes unglued by his growing perception of institutional racism, and season finale \"&amp;hellip;and Zeus Wept,\" a nightmarish thriller about a school shooting. &lt;I&gt;--Tom Keogh&lt;/I&gt;']</td>\n",

This historic studio was at one time home to a staggering number of silent screen luminaries including &lt;b&gt;Mabel Normand, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Harry Langdon, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, The Keystone Cops, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Billy Bevan, Louise Fazenda, Eddie Quillan,&lt;/b&gt; and countless others. Even Hollywood icon &lt;b&gt;Charlie Chaplin&lt;/b&gt;, still the world's most recognized actor, introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone. Later, under the Mack Sennett Comedies banner, Sennett went on to produce a new generation of sound comedies, some in early color, featuring the likes of &lt;b&gt;W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby, Lloyd Hamilton, Andy Clyde,&lt;/b&gt; and more.\", 'Now, for the first time, thanks to Flicker Alley, CineMuseum, and Keystone Films, &lt;b&gt;50 of the best surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re-mastered in HD for Blu-ray home video. &lt;/b&gt; These new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, the Richard M.

There is scarcely a physical clown or verbal wiseguy whose antics or attitude Sennett did not anticipate. Writing in &lt;i&gt;Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies&lt;/i&gt;, the cultural historian Robert Sklar cited Sennett's 'inventive, resourceful vulgarity,' crediting his primitive two-reel comedies with 'cutting a wider swath through society and its values than any previous expression of the comic tradition in America, with the single exception of that 19th-century masterpiece of comic prose, &lt;i&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt;.' --&lt;b&gt;J.

From 3 p.m. into the late night, dedicated police, paramedics and firefighters battle crime and cheat death--if they're lucky. Risking their own lives to save others, the men and women of this strange breed prove they've got what it takes to make it through the night and return the next day to face their harsh reality.\", \"<I>Third Watch: The Complete Second Season</I> continues the critically acclaimed television drama's unique approach to character-driven storylines within a fluid if somewhat familiar milieu. Almost anticipating the now-legendary heroism of New York City's police and rescue workers on September 11, 2001, these early episodes of <I>Third Watch</I> (the series began in 1999) concern the daily partnership and shared risks between New York cops, firefighters, and paramedics as they attempt to keep people alive in the midst of random chaos. While television shows about public servants are nothing new, what makes <I>Third Watch</I> both different and engrossing is the way creators John Wells (<I>ER</I>) and Edward Allen Bernero (<I>Criminal Minds</I>) hone in on one or two characters in each episode, relegating the rest of the cast to minor supporting roles. Thus, an individual who stands out in one episode for his or her efforts to do the job well--despite real-world pressures, lapses in judgment, and moral uncertainty--might appear only briefly, and perhaps less sympathetically, in another episode as seen from a different character's perspective.\", 'That kind of revolving focus not only keeps <I>Third Watch</I> constantly fresh, it embraces master filmmaker Jean Renoir\\'s famous observation (paraphrased here) that each of us has a reason for being who we are and doing what we do. Beyond its success at turning such an expansive spirit into appealing drama, <I>Third Watch</I> is also noteworthy for superb writing (much of it by Wells), harrowing set pieces, production values that stress an original, signature look, and a strong emphasis on relationships between on-the-job partners. The cast remains superb, particularly Jason Wiles as an immature, cynical, yet oddly effective young cop, Molly Price as his beleaguered but dedicated partner, and Skipp Sudduth as a veteran police officer whose leadership on the streets belies his rudderless off-duty existence. Among some truly memorable episodes in <I>The Complete Second Season</I> are \"Four Days,\" in which one of the program\\'s most stable characters, African-American paramedic \"Doc\" Parker (Michael Beach), slowly comes unglued by his growing perception of institutional racism, and season finale \"&hellip;and Zeus Wept,\" a nightmarish thriller about a school shooting. <I>--Tom Keogh</I>']   \n",

This historic studio was at one time home to a staggering number of silent screen luminaries including <b>Mabel Normand, Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Harry Langdon, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, The Keystone Cops, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Billy Bevan, Louise Fazenda, Eddie Quillan,</b> and countless others. Even Hollywood icon <b>Charlie Chaplin</b>, still the world's most recognized actor, introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone. Later, under the Mack Sennett Comedies banner, Sennett went on to produce a new generation of sound comedies, some in early color, featuring the likes of <b>W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby, Lloyd Hamilton, Andy Clyde,</b> and more.\", 'Now, for the first time, thanks to Flicker Alley, CineMuseum, and Keystone Films, <b>50 of the best surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re-mastered in HD for Blu-ray home video. </b> These new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, the Richard M.

All true, but as demonstrated by the 50 mainly short films digitally restored and gathered in a three-disc Blu-ray set, <b><i>The Mack Sennett Collection Volume One</i></b> (Flicker Alley), he was something more.', \"Sennett defined (or redefined) American humor. There is scarcely a physical clown or verbal wiseguy whose antics or attitude Sennett did not anticipate. Writing in <i>Movie-Made America: A Cultural History of American Movies</i>, the cultural historian Robert Sklar cited Sennett's 'inventive, resourceful vulgarity,' crediting his primitive two-reel comedies with 'cutting a wider swath through society and its values than any previous expression of the comic tradition in America, with the single exception of that 19th-century masterpiece of comic prose, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>.' --<b>J. Hoberman, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br /><br />The Sennett box is a frankly amazing cavalcade of low comedy that's both culturally revelatory and often hilarious (not to mention jaw-droppingly tasteless). --<b>RogerEbert.com</b><br /><br />The subtitle of this three-disc set of silent-era classics is '50 Digitally Restored Classic Films;' but that doesn't even begin to describe what <b><i>The Mack Sennett Collection</i></b>; has to offer. The real value is in the commentary tracks by scholars and archivists who talk about how one of Hollywood's all-time greats gathered and nurtured a phenomenal collection of comic talent. --<b>'Noel Murray's Best DVDs of 2014,' <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></b>\"]   \n",
