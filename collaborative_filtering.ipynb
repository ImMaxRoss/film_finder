    "# Project Overview\n",
    "The main goal for this project is to Develop a hybrid movie/TV recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest new content to users. Currently, these techniques are applied independently. Our project aims to harness their combined potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes existing user profiles to discover shared preferences and recommend new content based on similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests new content with similar fearures to the movie/TV show that you input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "As streaming platforms pile-up content, users struggle to pinpoint films or shows that align with their tastes. The dubious presence of bias in platform algorithms exacerbates this challenge, making it harder for users to rely on platform recommendations. Biases emerge from factors like skewed user preferences, popularity bias, or even the platform's promotional agenda. As a result, recommended content may not cater to users' unique tastes, negatively affecting the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Streaming platforms stand to gain from implementing an unbiased hybrid recommendation system that blends content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. This approach leverages the best of both methods, increasing reliability and personalization while mitigating biases. The content-based technique analyzes features like genre and content description, while collaborative filtering harnesses the collective trends of user ratings. Together, they forge a powerful recommendation engine, enhancing user satisfaction and overall experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "In the collaborative filtering approach, we focused on user-to-user filtering, comparing users' profiles to identify similarities in movie preferences by looking at the ratings they gave to movies that they have both watched. We started by creating a base model as a benchmark, which predicted the mean rating for each movie. To improve the recommendations, we iterated over two models: an SVD model and an SVDpp model. In the iteration process, we used cross-validation in tandem with GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for our models, optimizing their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cross-validation and GridSearchCV process helped us fine-tune our models to achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score of 0.908. Given that our dataset contains user ratings on a scale of 1 to 5, a 0.908 RMSE score signifies good performance in predicting users' movie ratings. It indicates that, on average, our model's predictions deviate by 0.908 from the actual user ratings. This performance enables more accurate and personalized recommendations for users based on their shared preferences, enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "During the analysis of the collaborative filtering recommendation system, we found that recommendations for users with limited high-rated Comedy TV Shows didn't align well with their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Causes\n",
    "- **Vast dataset**: The large and diverse dataset may cause users with a small set of highly-rated videos to correlate strongly with users who reviewed varied movies but rated the same shows highly.\n",
    "- **Similarity metric**: The current system treats varied-preference users as similar, resulting in inaccurate recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Actions\n",
    "- **Increase minimum reviews**: Filter users with more than the current minimum number of reviews (4) for better comparisons.\n",
    "- **Customize similarity metric**: Implement a weighted similarity metric considering overlapping movies and users' genre importance.\n",
    "- **Hybrid approach**: Use a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods to account for user and movie attributes, generating better recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps could potentially enhance the recommendation system's effectiveness, providing more relevant recommendations for each user profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### future steps sidenote: Since the dataset is so large, it may make more sense to use the BaselineOnly model if not able to increase the difference in the hyperparameter tuned final model in order to save computation."
