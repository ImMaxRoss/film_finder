      "Movie 3: My Run\n",
      "Description: After tragically losing his wife to breast cancer and struggling to raise three young children on his own, real life super hero and modern day Forrest Gump, Terry Hitchcock seized on an idea. He wanted to accomplish the impossible: run 75 consecutive marathons in 75 consecutive days to bring attention to the incredibly difficult lives of single-parent families. He ran in spite of freezing rain and unbearable heat, in spite of chest pains and bone fractures that wracked his 57-year-old body. He just kept running - each day, every day - strengthening an unbreakable bond between father and son - not stopping until he broke the finish line tape in Atlanta. <i>MY RUN</i> is more than a film about a guy running multiple marathons; it's a film about the daily marathons we all run in life. Narrated by Academy Award&reg; Winner Billy Bob Thornton. &#34;It's truly a story of endurance and faith.&#34; --The Dove Foundation<br /><br />&#34;A superb portrayal of the human realities.&#34; --Mammoth Times<br /><br />Your film is so important to raising awareness of so many issues including the power of the human spirit. Mr. Hitchcock's vision and story is one I will never forget.&#34; --Doug Ulman, President/CEO of Livestrong\n",
